TerrorAsym is the **base mod** for the additional mods.

## What is TerrorAsym?
TerrorAsym is a mod that adds functions/utilities/resources for assymetrical horror games in **Minecraft Java Edition**

## Where the ideia came from?
"Can **I** recreate roblox's asymetrical horror games in **Minecraft**?" - Eduardo7881's Last Infamous Words.

## How to use TerrorAsym
You can't use TerrorAsym, as it is the base mod for additional mods with the main game. It only provides functions/utilities/resources and etc... for the game.

## Installing Plug-ins
You can install plugins (aka. *Games*) in the folder `.minecraft\TerrorAsym\games`.

## Using Plug-ins
You can use plug-ins using the internal base mod commands. Allowing you to start the round, select an killer, change the player's skin, add abilities to him (aka. **Items wich can be used** lol), end the round, change timer state (**enabled** or **disabled**) and etc...

## Development State
THIS BASE MOD is currently based on pure **Minecraft: Java Edition 1.8** (as for now, i need to learn Forge/Fabric)
Still **Work in Progress* and not released to the public.

## The Objective
Playable Assymetrical Horror games in Minecraft.
Why? Because it's cool
